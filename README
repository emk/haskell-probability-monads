This is an email classifier based on Martin Erwig's and Steve
Kollmansberger's "Probabilistic Functional Programming"[1].



Build
-----
Run `cabal install` 

Classify 
--------
To train the classifier add mails in `Spam/hamEmails/` and `Spam/spamEmails`

Put the content of your mail in `mail.txt` and run classify.











This is a probability library inspired by Martin Erwig's and Steve
Kollmansberger's "Probabilistic Functional Programming"[1], but with many
additions and an underlying structure factored into monad transformers.

You will need MaybeT and MonadRandom from HackageDB:

  http://hackage.haskell.org/packages/archive/pkg-list.html

...or from Darcs:

  http://code.haskell.org/maybet/
  http://code.haskell.org/monadrandom/

To install, type:

  runhaskell Setup.hs configure
  runhaskell Setup.hs build
  runhaskell Setup.hs install

To build documentation, make sure Haddock is installed, and type:

  runhaskell Setup.hs haddock

This library is highly experimental, and the APIs may change without
notice.

The actual implementations of the probability monads currently appear in
examples/Probability.hs.  These will eventually be moved into the main
library.
